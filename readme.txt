Add a ManageWP.org sharing button to the Jetpack Sharing module

== Description ==

Extends the Jetpack plugin and allows you to add a ManageWP.org sharing button to the list of sharing services available under Settings > Sharing in your dashboard.

Important: for this plugin to work, you must activate [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) first, and activate the Sharing module.

This plugin is a work in progress. You can report issues [here](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/mwp-sharing-jetpack), or submit a pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/jeherve/mwp-sharing-jetpack/).

Kudos to [Jeff](https://twitter.com/jeffr0) who gave me the idea for this plugin ([#](http://www.wptavern.com/how-to-add-a-managewp-button-to-jetpack-sharing))!
